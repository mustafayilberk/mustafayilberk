# 👋 Hi, I'm Mustafa Yılberk

I am an Aerospace Engineering student developing myself in **avionics, control systems, embedded systems, and materials/composites**.  
My long-term goal is to become a multidisciplinary engineer capable of building complete UAV systems—from system architecture and electronics to control algorithms and structural design.

I am currently following a structured **3-year engineering development program** covering software, hardware, system design, and practical aerospace applications.

# 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 **Thrust Calculation & Motor Classification (C)**
A set of C programs that:
- Compute thrust using RPM and motor constant *k*  
- Classify motors as **Weak / Medium / Strong**  
- Demonstrate branching, variables, numerical formulas, and user input  

➡️ Repo: **https://github.com/mustafayilberk/c-thrust-calculations**

More embedded, control, and avionics projects will be added as I progress.
